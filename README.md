# NLPoetry
"Infinite Inspiration, Endless Expressions"

## Desc :
This is a class project for our NLP class, 

In this project we aim to fine-tune a LLM model (possibly Mixtral 8x7b) to generate poems in French according to a given theme, author style or date.

We got the data via web scraping the website poesie-francaise.fr on the 21st of April 2024.
